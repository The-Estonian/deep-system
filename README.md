# Deep in system

## Project Description

As per project requirements i installed Linux on VirtualBox and reformated the Hard drive to have 30gb of room with partitioned folders as required.

I gave the VM a static IP of 192.168.8.100 that persists on reboots

I changed ssh port to 2222 and created 3 users with required permissions:

luffy - sudo admin - login via key
zoro - normal user - login via password
nami - ftp user - login via password

I installed MySql server on the VM with Wordpress and opened ports in firewall for the Wordpress site to be available outside of VM as required.

Ports:
2222 ssh connection
21 ftp
80, 443 Wordpress

I created cronjob for the wordpress database to be saved every 1m
