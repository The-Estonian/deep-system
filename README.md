# Deep in system

## Project Description

The project consists of 8 different types of network interfaces that increase in complexity.

The last, 8th project consists of a 3 router system where each of the routers has a switch connected to them and Computers connected to the switches.

The computers communication is being handled by switches that use routers to route connections between eachother if the target computer is connected to other router.

Subnets are being implemented to keep local IPs separate from eachother to avoid ip conflicts.

Computers 0 -> 4 just need to use switch to communicate between eachother, in case one of those computers needs to connect to Computers above 4 on the network then the connection will be routed through the switch to the router and from the routers to the switch and target computer.
